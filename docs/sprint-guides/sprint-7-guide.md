# Sprint 7: Streaming Data Ingestion

## Goal
Build real-time order event streaming with Redpanda

## Learning Objectives
- Understand streaming concepts and architecture
- Set up Redpanda (Kafka-compatible) locally
- Create producers and consumers
- Implement fault-tolerant streaming

## Daily Tasks
**Day 1:** Streaming fundamentals and Redpanda setup
**Day 2:** Producer development and message serialization
**Day 3:** Consumer implementation and processing
**Day 4:** Error handling and exactly-once processing
**Day 5:** Performance optimization and monitoring

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Redpanda running locally with topics
- [ ] Producer generating order events
- [ ] Consumer processing streams
- [ ] Fault tolerance implemented

## Key Concepts
- Producers/Consumers
- Topics and partitions
