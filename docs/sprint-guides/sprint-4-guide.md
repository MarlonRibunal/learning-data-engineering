# Sprint 4: Big Data Processing with Spark

## Goal
Process large clickstream datasets with PySpark on Databricks

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Spark architecture and distributed computing
- Work with Spark DataFrames and RDDs
- Perform large-scale data transformations
- Optimize Spark jobs for performance

## Daily Tasks
**Day 1:** Spark fundamentals, Databricks Community Edition setup
**Day 2:** PySpark DataFrame API - transformations and actions
**Day 3:** Data processing on large datasets (100k+ records)
**Day 4:** Advanced aggregations and analytics
**Day 5:** Performance optimization and Delta tables

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Databricks cluster running with PySpark
- [ ] Large clickstream dataset processed
- [ ] Complex aggregations implemented
- [ ] Performance optimizations applied

## Key Concepts
- Lazy evaluation
- Transformations vs Actions
