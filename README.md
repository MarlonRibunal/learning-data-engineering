## Welcome to Your Data Engineering Journey!

**Tired of piecing together scattered tutorials and wrestling with complex local setups?** You've found the solution.

This isn't just another tutorial repository—it's a **complete, production-ready learning environment** that mirrors real-world data engineering workflows. Whether you're transitioning into data engineering, leveling up your skills, or building your portfolio, this platform provides everything you need in one place.

### Why This Platform Exists

Data engineering is one of the fastest-growing fields in tech, but learning it effectively requires:
- **Real infrastructure** (not just isolated code examples)
- **Production patterns** (not just theoretical concepts)  
- **Portfolio projects** (not just hello-world tutorials)
- **Community support** (not just solo learning)

We've built the platform we wish existed when we started our data engineering journeys.

## What Makes This Different?

| Traditional Learning | This Platform |
|---------------------|---------------|
| ❌ Scattered tutorials | ✅ **Structured 6-month blueprint** |
| ❌ Local installations | ✅ **100% containerized** |
| ❌ Theoretical concepts | ✅ **Real portfolio projects** |
| ❌ Solo learning | ✅ **Community-driven** |

## One-Command Setup

> **Windows Users:** Use Git Bash • **Mac/Linux Users:** Use Terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marlonribunal/learning-data-engineering.git
cd learning-data-engineering
./bootstrap.sh
```

**That's it!** Your complete data engineering environment automatically builds and will be ready at:

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Airflow** | http://localhost:8080 | `admin` / `admin` |
| **Streamlit Dashboard** | http://localhost:8501 | - |
| **PGAdmin** | http://localhost:8081 | `admin@datamart.com` / `admin` |
| **Redpanda Console** | http://localhost:8082 | - |
